**AIDE** is a Java library for the development and testing of
intelligent agents. It is used create and interface custom agents
and environments. It also contains tools to run simulations and
gather results.

**Agents** will have access to the following information:
- Array of *Actions* available in **Environment**.
- Array of *Percepts* passed from **Environment**.
- Array of *Goal Percepts* for the **Environment**.

Using this information, the **Agents** should decide what
*Action* to take, and the **Environment** will be updated
according to it.

## Code Example

## Motivation

This project is designed with the intention of creating a way of
rapid prototyping agents and environments for A.I. research. The
project will be used to facilitate research Artificial General
Intelligence by creating a framework for agents to be tested in
multiple unique and unknown environments.

## Installation

Download and import AIDE.jar into Java project.

**Note:** AIDE is still under development and AIDE.jar may be unavailable.
